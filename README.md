# systemsprogramming
Programs I have created over the course of my time in Systems Programming (CPE 357), a C course from the system programming perspective.

<h1> Labs </h1>
<h2>Lab 1 </h2> Simple program to print a christmas tree using * characters.
<h2>Lab 2 </h2> Program that creates a doubly linked list using char arrays as the data.
<h2>Lab 3 </h2> Basic implementation of memory, using malloc() and free().
<h2>Lab 4 </h2> Script to brighten a bitmap image using multi-core processing, utilizing the fork() method.
<h2>Lab 5 </h2> Small lab to practicing using fork() and wait() methods.
<h2>Lab 6 </h2> Program that forks an indestructable child, which does not respond to external kill signals. 
<h2>Lab 7 </h2> Two programs which both utilize difficult mutual exclusion algorithms, which are Eisenberg & McGuire's algorithm and
 Maekawa's algorithm.
<h2>Lab 8 </h2> A program to represent a pipe.

<h1> Assignments </h1>
<h2>Assignment 1 </h2> Program to blend two bitmap images together, taking the averages of their pixel's colors and storing each average in a new bitmap image. This
program does support images with different sizes.
<h2>Assignment 2 </h2> A low-level implemenation of malloc(), using the brk() and sbrk() methods.
<h2>Assignment 3 </h2> A file-explorer shell that uses a child process to montior files in the current working directory.
<h2>Assignment 4 </h2> A search engine shell that forks its search processes as child processes, allowing the parent process to receive input while the child process is searching.


<h1> Final </h1>
A message-pass interface that utlizes multicore processing to perform a matrix multiplication across mutliple cores.
